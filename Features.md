# SpottablAssignment

Hello everyone!

I have created a simple page for assigning, unassigning, searching and listing of the users using ReactJs.

The main features of this page includes:

1. UI as mentioned in the shared document i.e.: 
   1.1. Title, logo and description on the header
   1.2. Search Bar 
   1.3. User Listing Page 
   1.4. User Card with delete functionality 
   1.5. Searching with Name and email both

2. Usage of React FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS with HOOKS as well as CLASS COMPONENTS.

3. UI includes individual components and these have been reused wherever it was needed.

4. RESPONSIVE PAGE with the help of @media query.

5. Used LOCAL STORAGE for keeping and persisting data.

6. Added some additional UI ENHANCEMENTS too.

Thank you!
